# Exploratory DataAn Alysis - Course1 Project

Hi, thank you for taking the time to review the material for this assignment. In order to test the different plotting programms you need first to run **DataTool.R**. Instead of going thrue loading and preparing the data for each plot, I use a unique process to prepare the data for all the ploting work with Plot1 ~ Plot4 R Programs.

Kind Regards,

JLP
